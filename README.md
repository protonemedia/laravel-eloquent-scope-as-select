## Blogpost

If you want to know more about the background of this package, please read the blogpost: [Stop duplicating your Eloquent query scopes and constraints. Re-use them as select statements with a new Laravel package](https://protone.media/blog/stop-duplicating-your-eloquent-query-scopes-and-constraints-re-use-them-as-select-statements-with-a-new-laravel-package).

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require protonemedia/laravel-eloquent-scope-as-select
```

Add the `macro` to the query builder, for example, in your `AppServiceProvider`. By default, the name of the macro is `addScopeAsSelect`, but you can customize it with the first parameter of the `addMacro` method.

```php
use ProtoneMedia\LaravelEloquentScopeAsSelect\ScopeAsSelect;

public function boot()
{
    ScopeAsSelect::addMacro();

    // or use a custom method name:
    ScopeAsSelect::addMacro('withScopeAsSubQuery');
}
```

## Short API description

*For a more practical explanation, check out the [usage](#usage) section below.*

Add a select using a Closure. Each `Post` model, published or not, will have an `is_published` attribute.
```php
Post::addScopeAsSelect('is_published', function ($query) {
    $query->published();
})->get();
```

The example above can be shortened by using a string, where the second argument is the name of the scope:
```php
Post::addScopeAsSelect('is_published', 'published')->get();
```

You can use an array to call multiple scopes:
```php
Post::addScopeAsSelect('is_popular_and_published', ['popular', 'published'])->get();
```

Use an associative array to call dynamic scopes:
```php
Post::addScopeAsSelect('is_announcement', ['ofType' => 'announcement'])->get();
```

If your dynamic scopes require multiple arguments, you can use an associative array:
```php
Post::addScopeAsSelect('is_announcement', ['publishedBetween' => [2010, 2020]])->get();
```

You can also mix dynamic and non-dynmaic scopes:
```php
Post::addScopeAsSelect('is_published_announcement', [
    'published',
    'ofType' => 'announcement'
])->get();
```

The method has an optional third argument that flips the result.
```php
Post::addScopeAsSelect('is_not_announcement', ['ofType' => 'announcement'], false)->get();
```


## Usage

Imagine you have a `Post` Eloquent model with a query scope.

```php
class Post extends Model
{
    public function scopePublished($query)
    {
        return $query->whereNotNull('published_at');
    }
}
```

Now you can fetch all published posts by calling the scope method on the query:

```php
$allPublishedPosts = Post::published()->get();
```

But what if you want to fetch *all* posts and *then* check if the post is published? This scope is quite simple, so you can easily mimic the scope's outcome by checking the `published_at` attribute:

```php
Post::get()->each(function (Post $post) {
    $isPublished = !is_null($post->published_at);
});
```

This is harder to achieve when scopes get more complicated or when you chain various scopes. Let's add a relationship and another scope to the `Post` model:

```php
class Post extends Model
{
    public function comments()
    {
        return $this->hasMany(Comment::class);
    }

    public function scopePublished($query)
    {
        return $query->whereNotNull('published_at');
    }

    public function scopePublishedInCurrentYear($query)
    {
        return $query->whereYear('published_at', date('Y'));
    }
}
```

Using Eloquent, we can fetch all posts from this year with at least ten comments.

```php
$recentPopularPosts = Post::query()
    ->publishedInCurrentYear()
    ->has('comments', '>=', 10)
    ->get();
```

Great! Now we want to fetch all posts again, and then check if the post was published this year and has at least ten comments.

```php
Post::get()->each(function (Post $post) {
    $isRecentAndPopular = $post->comments()->count() >= 10
        && optional($post->published_at)->isCurrentYear();
});
```

Well, you get the idea. This is bound to get messy and you're duplicating logic as well.

### Solution

Using the power of this package, you can re-use your scopes when fetching data. The first example (`published` scope) can be narrowed down to:

```php
$posts = Post::addScopeAsSelect('is_published', function ($query) {
    $query->published();
})->get();
```

With short closures, a feature which was introduced in PHP 7.4, this can be even shorter:

```php
$posts = Post::addScopeAsSelect('is_published', fn ($query) => $query->published())->get();
```

Now every `Post` model will have an `is_published` boolean attribute.

```php
$posts->each(function (Post $post) {
    $isPublished = $post->is_published;
});
```

You can add multiple selects as well, for example, to combine both scenarios:

```php
Post::query()
    ->addScopeAsSelect('is_published', function ($query) {
        $query->published();
    })
    ->addScopeAsSelect('is_recent_and_popular', function ($query) {
        $query->publishedInCurrentYear()->has('comments', '>=', 10);
    })
    ->get()
    ->each(function (Post $post) {
        $isPublished = $post->is_published;

        $isRecentAndPopular = $post->is_recent_and_popular;
    });
```

### Shortcuts

Instead of using a Closure, there are some shortcuts you could use (see also: [Short API description](#short-api-description)):

Using a string instead of a Closure:

```php
Post::addScopeAsSelect('is_published', function ($query) {
    $query->published();
});

// is the same as:

Post::addScopeAsSelect('is_published', 'published');
```

Using an array instead of Closure, to support multiple scopes and dynamic scopes:

```php
Post::addScopeAsSelect('is_announcement', function ($query) {
    $query->ofType('announcement');
});

// is the same as:

Post::addScopeAsSelect('is_announcement', ['ofType' => 'announcement']);
```

You can also flip the result with the optional third parameter (it defaults to `true`):

```php
$postA = Post::addScopeAsSelect('is_announcement', ['ofType' => 'announcement'])->first();
$postB = Post::addScopeAsSelect('is_not_announcement', ['ofType' => 'announcement'], false)->first();

$this->assertTrue($postA->is_announcement)
$this->assertFalse($postB->is_not_announcement);
```

### Testing

``` bash
composer test
```
